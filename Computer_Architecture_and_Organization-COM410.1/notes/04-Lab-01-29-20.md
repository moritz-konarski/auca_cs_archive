# Lab 29.01.2020

- logging into the server or setting up the working environment
- we'll work with assembly files and then go ahead with stuff
- well do some linking and just optimizing a bit of asm
- `@plt` is some table that allows you to call functions from outside of your
program
- topic is `position independent code`, look that up
- `plt` table has the locations of all the functions that you might want to
call from you program
- `got` global offset table works with `plt` to make it happen
- `xor %eax, %eax` can also be used instead of `mov $0, %rax`, xor with itselg
sets all the bits to zero in `%eax`
- `%eax` is half of `%rax`, meaning that we can set `%rax` to zero by calling 
`xor` on `%eax`
- well use `syscall` in lab 3 to do some stuff
- look at the `syscall` docs linked in lab 3
- number 03 will not be on the exam
