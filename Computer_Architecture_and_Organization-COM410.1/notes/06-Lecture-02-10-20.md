- every processing cycle does
    - _fetch:_
        - many modern CPUs fetch hundrets of instructions in one go and then
        runs through all them, they are saved in L1 cache
        - 
    - _decode:_
    - _execute:_
    - _memory:_
    - _write back:_
- _fetch_ and _write back_ can be combined into one thing
- each cycle the `PC` (program counter) is incremented
- pipelining can be somewhat compared to a car factory -- you perform the first
step of the first instruction moving on to the second step, then you perform
the first step of the second instruction and so on
- this can be very efficient because there is little time being wasted
- _forwarding, pipelining, cutting in line, and the other techniques_
