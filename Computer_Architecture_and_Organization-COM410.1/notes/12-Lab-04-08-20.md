# Lab 08.04.2020

- the project will be the same as the final defense
- ask him to post the templates on e-course or github because I never use the
server and never have used it
- template1.s is a pseudorandom number generator
- just do all the stuff that piazza tells us to do
- the next classes will probably be cancelled -- next week and so on
- the project will be done by us ourselves and there is nothing really left for
him to teach us
- all the sources and references are on the piazza page
- SIMD: only use AVX and the XMM- registers because that is all the server
supports 
- Bektur has a fork of Toksaitov's code that we can look at and then use
- maybe optimize the code to recognize which type of SIMD is supported to
really speed it up
- we have the references, we just need to find the function we need
- just do all the tasks -- put them into a big make file and run with it
- we can allocate space using C++ if we want 
- for the next 4 weeks there will be no lab classes
- we have to convert ints to floats too at some point
- when we are done just contact him and set a date for the check
