# Lecture 03.02.2020

- we are going to try to link the labs and the lectures together
- we're going to chapter 4 and x86-64 architecture
- learning an ISA
    - if you know how the processor works helps you understand how the whole
    computer works
    - understanding how CPUs work can help you write better code as well
    - helps one make decisions on hardware design
    - maybe some of us will work on actual CPU design
- registers are used as super fast short term storage
- program counter keeps track of the instructions that are being executed at
the moment
- condition code
- status code indicates the overall state of the programs execution
- Y86 has immediate to memory, register to memory, memory to register, register
to register moves
- logic gates are the basic components of a CPU and a PC in general, how they
work is not to complicated at the basics, but it gets super complex if you have
billions of them

`hello_world.c`
```c
    #include <stdio.h>

    int main() {
        puts("Hello, World!\n");
        return 0;
    }
```
`hello_world.asm`
```asm
    main:
        subq    $8,    %rsp
        movl    $.LC0, %edi
        call    puts
        movl    $0,    %eax
        addq    $8,    %rsp
        ret
```
`sum.c`
```c
    long sum(long *start, long count) {
        long sum = 0;
        while (count) {
            sum += *start;
            start++;
            count--;
        }
        return sum;
    }
```
`sum.asm`
```asm 
    sum:
        movl    $0,     %eax
        jmp     .L2
    .L2:
        addq    (%rdi), %rax
        addq    $8,     %rdi
        subq    $1,     %rsi
    .L3:
        testq   %rsi,   %rsi
        jne     .L3
        rep; ret
```
