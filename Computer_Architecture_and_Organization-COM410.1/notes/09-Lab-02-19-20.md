- doing a fibonacci loop
- writing a recursive function for gce
- values for multiplication should be in `%rax` and another register, result is
in `%rdx` and `rax`
- division: `%rax` and another register, `%rax` has full result, `%rdx` has
remainder
- _we can skip the next classes if we don't have any questions_
- look at chapter 3 of the book for memory allocation, recursive procedures
etc. 
- look at inline assembly
