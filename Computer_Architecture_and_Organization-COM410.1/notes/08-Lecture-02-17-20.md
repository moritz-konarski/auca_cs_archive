# Lecture 17.02.2020

- we will review stuff before the midterm
- midterm will be on chapters 1, 2, 3, and a little bit of 4
- bits and bytes will be the topic for today
- `0x01234567` stored as
    - `01 | 23 | 45 | 67` in big endian
    - `67 | 45 | 23 | 01` in little endian
- three types of notations
    - unsigned notation -- standard binary or hex encoding
    - signed notation (two's complement) -- inverting digits and adding one to
    represent negative numbers
    - floating point -- mathematical/scientific notation of numbers with
    rational number and exponent
- types might not be the same length of bits between different machines and
operating systems -- super important to keep that in mind when dealing with
this kind of stuff
- we can do bit shifting `x >> 4` to the right or `x << 4` to the left, for
example `0101 0111 >> 4 = 0000 0101`
- arithmetic shifting `10010101 >> 4 = 11111001` uses the digit in the
left most place to fill the new places
- bit masking using `&` like `0x25AF3255 & 0x00FF0000 = 0x00AF0000`
- remember little and big endian -- big endian means that the most significant
bit comes first, little endian means that the least significant bit is first
- `&` logical and, `|` logical or, `^` logical xor, `~` logical not
- __read Chapter 2__
- overflow is a thing as well -- two positive numbers added together could
yield a negative result for example -- we need to pay attention to that
