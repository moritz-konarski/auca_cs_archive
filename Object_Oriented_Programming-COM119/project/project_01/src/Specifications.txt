#Herein find the specifications for the first project of OOP

#Classes (as many as possible)
    -Snake
    -Field
    -Apple (Food)
    -don't mix data and presentation, so move the draw methods to the drawing classes

#Methods
    -Field:
        -width
        -height
        -standard is 40 x 40
    -simplify all the drawing to be able to do it only in main
    -rename main class to Main

#Graphics


#Main as the render class
private void draw(Screen currentScreen) {
    TODO:
    background
    draw buttons
    draw buttonText
    draw field + Snake
    draw table
}

NEXT CLASS 12.04.2019

//============================How to improve the program========================================================
TODO from this particular session:
    -refactoring the code:
        *removing some useless methods
        *getting rid of other functions that we do not need
        *make variables local to methods wherever possible
    -moving on to the apple class:
        *coordinates of the apple
        *color of the apple
        *constructor (snake position, field size) {coordinates are random, they shall not collide with the snake's position}
        *int[] getPosition()
        *he makes some getters and setters that I do not need because I only draw in Main.java
    -moving on to the snake class:
        *add a graphical tail to the snake
        *enable move by passing the movement vector, might not be safe, but it is simpler
        *isInside method for the field
        *instant turning for the snake
