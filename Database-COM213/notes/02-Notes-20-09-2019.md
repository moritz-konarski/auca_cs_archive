Notes on second Lecture
=======================

Models
------

-   some form of abstraction that makes life easier
-   formulas in mathematics are models of something
-   **do not focus on the diagram, it's the database that matters**

Databases
---------

-   provide services: add, retrieve data, modify it, manage its storage
-   mostly based on set theory, so it does not change a lot
-   very mathematical, defined, 'conservative'

Servers
-------

-   hardware server: a dedicated piece of generally powerful hardware
-   software server: software that acts as a server, offers services
-   *information network servers that have something to do with
    information management*
-   software server: payment services, ATM backend, Google drive, DNS
    server

SQL
---

-   'Structured Query Language', sometimes sequel
-   DDL (Data Definition Language): allows to create data structures
    like tables, the db itself, etc
-   DML (Data Manipulation Language): to use the data and control the
    server

Names of classes for a pharmacy database
----------------------------------------

-   producers
-   logistics companies
-   locaions/shops
-   storage
-   transactions
-   import
-   something it has its own values: make it a table, if not: leave it
    as part of something else

Relationships
-------------

-   Students live in Cities: many to one
-   students to enrollment, which has courses
-   many to many relationships can be defined by intermediate tables
    that manage it

Lab
===

-   DDL and DML: the former for creating the db, building tables, data
    types, structures in general; the latter is for working with data
    and managing the running system
-   we should use CLUSTERED in the primary key: **why**?
