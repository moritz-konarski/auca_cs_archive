## Normalization

- splitting apart data into tables in order to minimize repetition
- different normal forms
- examples:
    - put phone number in different table, connect using ID
    - putting reused data into tables to reduce redundancy: table for countries
      and cities
- index types:
    - clustered: index is physically sorted by the clustered index -- it is
      really fast to find values; can be used with most data types, except for
      really large ones like varbinary(MAX); is generally used with Primary
      Key; can only have one clustered index per table, as it is physically
      sorted by the index; can be said to be ascending or descending, needs to
      be specified
    - non-clustered:
