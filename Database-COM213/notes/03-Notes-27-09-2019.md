# Notes

- how can we solve the timezone problem? We have timezones with fractional
  hours? This would mean we need NUMERIC instead of INT
- To assign variables to fields in a table:
    - 1 AS NumberOne
    - 'Hello' AS StringTwo
    - multiply numbers, concat strings
    - select * from Dishes where SectionId = 1 or SectionId = 2
    - use ORDER BY to sort the results by specific columns, ASC and DESC for
      reversing and normal mode
    - something LIKE 'H%' is a primitive regex
    - CASE WHEN as a primitive switch statement
    - throw some ELSE into the CASE statement and be happy about it
