## Database Design

1. Determine the purpose of the database : main idea
2. Gather the necessary information : interviews, read documents
3. ER modeling : extract the entities needed
4. determine the necessary relationships between entities based on the
   gathered information and logical relationships
5. all the constraints that the description of the database requires
    - determine the needed sql constraints for the database
    - determine the needed data types of the columns also NULL, NOT NULL; check
      constraint
6. business rules come from the requirements -- their implementations are
   constraints

A ton of different stuff that was super slow and boring. What is the difference
between business rules and constraints; how to avoid redundancy when dealing
with data.

- find examples of a system where changing of an attribute of one entity
  necessitates the changing of a row in another table
    - changing the weight of one ingredient changes the weight of the dish
    - salary increase of an employee increases the monthly expenditure of the
      department
    - student signs up for course and gets put into the list of students in
      course and the course needs to added to their transcript
    - if you have a table of winners of a game, and the prize for the game gets
      split between them you need to adjust the amount of money all them
      receive
    - if one person gets married to another person in the table one of them
      might change their name and both change their relationship status
    - _bank: accounts with money in them -- transfering money from one account to
      another will necessarily change the amount in two accounts -- the change
      in one causes the change in the other_
    - __in these cases we need to make sure that one change is always
      acconpanied by another change as these things go together__

## Transactions in SQL

- What is it?
    - transactions have to be done together and cannot be broken apart
- When is it used?
    - when we have to ensure the integrity of the database but constraints are
      not enough
- Why are they used?
    - because sometimes
- ACID
    - _A_tomicity: transaction cannot be broken apart
    - _C_onsistency: the state before and after the transaction must be
      consistent
    - _I_solation: there is no external influence while the transaction is
      going on
    - _D_urability: when the transaction completes it is done forever and it
      may not be changed back

# Lab Notes

- fix the diagrams to the requirements without any extra data -- it is not
  required
- continuation of indexes:
    - data pages accompany records and for clustered indexes they are sorted in
      the pages
    - 8 KB size per page in SQL server, all pages are connected as a linked
      list
    - there is a page that stores which indexes are on which page, making
      findig of a specific index very easy
- non-clustered index:
    - the data is nor stored in order
    - as a substitute they simply use a connection to a different clustered
      index system that tells you where a file is
    - read up on how non-clustered indexes work
