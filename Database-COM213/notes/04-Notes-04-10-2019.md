- do we create new data when we output stuff that is not originally in the
  database
- when we write Weight/454.0 AS WeightInPounds
- the information is already contained in the data, we just extract it 
- we cannot (generally) reconstruct source data from aggregate data
- e.g. with cooking, you lose water etc. so you don't have a simple aggregate
- with e.g. GPA, it's always the average of the grades, so it is not strictly
  necessary to store it separately
- if you store the it as well, you always have to keep it up to date, if you
  forget it you will corrupt your data
- it is a better choice not to store the data in most cases
- counter example: money of students' accounts (just product of transactions),
  so not really necessary, but with thousands of transactions it would be too
  computationally expensive to re-do it every time
- relational databases have all the information in tables: it's basically just
  a matrix, graphs can also be used (trees are here)
- vectors for sequences of values that follow each other
- points could be used to store scalar values, int, strings...
- 3D can be used to store analytical data
- subject, year, average grade in one table
- it can make is easier if you want to use the data further, takes away
  unnecessary data
- we can perform stuff like sorting, set operations

## Connecting different queries together

- SELECT Name FROM Ingredients UNION SELECT Name FROM Tags 
    - this will create a union of the two sets
    - UNION just gives unique results
    - UNION ALL will return all values, not just distinct ones
    - ORDER BY 1 will order by the results from a certain table
- EXCEPT will remove the second set of results from the first set of results (set
  subtraction)
- INTERSECT will produce the intersection of two sets based on some common
  parameter
- __we can use '[A-S]%' to specify certain ranges of letters__
- SELECT DISTINCT will remove all the duplicates
- SELECT TOP x will only show the top x results
- instead of a chain of OR, one may use IN(x, y, z), it gives a list of values
- IN can accept a query as an input for selecting stuff
- query results can be the object of queries themselves
- aliases can also be used for tables in FROM
- sub-queries need to be named because anonymous ones are not allowed

## JOINs:

- Sections AS s INNER JOIN Dishes AS d ON d.SectionID = s.ID
- inner join: returns all that matches
- left join: all from left table plus matching from other table
- right join: reversed left join
- full outer join: all from both
- cross join: returns all possible combinations of entries
