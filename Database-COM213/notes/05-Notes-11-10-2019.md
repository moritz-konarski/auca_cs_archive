# Lecture Notes

- some problems will be re-judged because people cheated
- Why could an accepted solution be rejected?
    - because people were hard coding the ID of certain things like ID = 3
    - surrogate ID have no intrinsic value in the real world
    - so we should not rely on them
- Data Owner: who owns the data? __research data ownership ideas__
- What is the purpose of these systems? 
    - it makes it easier or even possible to manage large amounts of data
    - it is a lot more efficient than paper
    - can provide information to support decision-making
    - increases security in certain cases
    - optimizing business processes
    - __They create some kind of data which was not originally collected -> There is a gain
      in information that would not be there without it__
- Aggregate Functions:
    - a function that takes data as an input, and returns a defined result
    - e.g. AVG, SUM, COUNT/LEN, MAX, MIN, FIRST, MEDIAN, TOP
    - some examples from real life
    - COUNT (DISTINCT \<table\>): does not count duplicates
    - COUNT \*: it counts all things, even NULL
    - COUNT(\*) for all, COUNT(n) where there is a specific column
    - GROUP BY can be used to group results into certain sections to make
      queries simpler, it uses other rows as grouping sources

# Lab Notes

- RIGHT JOIN: take all from the right table and add that from the left table
  that fit to the criteria
- LEFT JOIN: take all of the left table, and add that from the second table
  that fits
