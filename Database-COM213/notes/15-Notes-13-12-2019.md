## Physical Structure of DBs

- DBs generally accessed using web applications or other intermediate programs
- SSMS is just a tool to work with the SQL server 
- DBs are distributed between multiple harddrives etc -- something we need to
think about
- the physical database should be considered when designing the database system
-- some implementations can be faster than others on certain types of hardware
- data that is spread across multiple hard drives will be seen as one logical
unit for the SQL server
- stuff is organized in file groups
- the actual data is organized in data pages -- which are organized in data
files
- a table can be made up of many data pages
- a data page has a size of 8KB -- 10% of that is meta data, 90% actual data
- info about what tables we have is stored in sys.tables, sys.colums,
    sys.foreign_keys ...
database structure
- primary file group
    - .mdf, .ndf data files
        - extents (8 pages)
            - 8 pages a 8KB
- .ldf log files

# Lab notes

- __more stuff on the boring indexes__
- this shit is so boring

## Transactions

- how they work and what even makes them transactions 
- isolation levels, read committed, read uncommitted etc
