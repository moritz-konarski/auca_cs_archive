# Notes on make-up class

- using AND in INNER JOIN can be better, it can definitely be more readable
- for certain operations it matters where this condition is put, whether it's
  in WHERE or in ON in the join
- it depends on what exactly we are looking for
- 4 commands of DML: SELECT, DELETE, UPDATE, INSERT
    - DELETE:
        - DELETE FROM Dishes WHERE Name = 'Turkey shank'
        - fails as there are foreign keys to this entry
        - it can also remove multiple things with the same name accidentally
        - before one may delete an entry, all references to it from other
          tables have to be remonved
        - DELETE FROM \<table\> WHERE \<condition\>
        - to be sure about what you delete, use SELECT instead, until you are
          happy with the result, only then DELETE
        - delete only deletes records from one table
    - UPDATE:
        - UPDATE Dishes SET Name = 'Turkey shank!!!' WHERE Name = 'Turkey
          shank'
        - maybe the most dangerous command in SQL DML, as it does not conflict
          with FK or the like
        - UPDATE Dishes SET Name = 'Turkey Shank - Special', Weight = 100 WHERE Name = 'Turkey Shank'
    - INSERT:
        - INSERT INTO \<table\> (\<cols\>) VALUES (\<corresponding values\>)
        - we can add more rows to the same statement by separating the tuples
          to be inserted by commas
        - the VALUES statement can also be used as a table in FROM in a select
          statement
        - then we need to provide an alias, as well as provide table column
          aliases like: FROM ( VALUES ...) AS \<alias\>(\<column names\>)
        - we can also use SELECT to provide data for INSERT: INSERT INTO
          \<table\> (\<columns\>) SELECT \<columns\> 
        - we would generally modify some values from the SELECT query, for
          example Weight * 0.8, Name + ' (Small)' to create small versions of
          existing dishes
