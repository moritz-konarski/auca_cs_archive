# Lecture Notes

- DB and software often work together so they cannot be divided that much
- game: What are the real steps of software development?
    - notes on this see week 13 of calender

# Lab notes

- next part of the course is designing complex database systems

## Writing complex databases

- write code for each class, get feedback there
- like a feedback/review process

# IoT Vending Machine

- a vending machine, internet enabled
- you use an app to scan a qr code and the doors open
- you take the products and RFID scans catch what was taken
- then you pay digitally

- price history should be tracked
- no age limit; no closing time -> 24/7/365 operation
- just keep all the data from stuff that was bought and don't delete any of it
- store the price of the product at the time of purchase
