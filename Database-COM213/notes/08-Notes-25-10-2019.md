# Notes on Lecture

- Gurinov's WhatsApp or Telegram: 0555-920-123 for questions I guess
- today: algorithms and process flow in SQL
- we played a game of kahoot with 8 questions for an hour

## Control Flow

- sometimes it is needed as e.g. verification should be done in the db
- some things are too complex to just write them on one line
- e.g. DECLARE @\<name\>, \<type\>
- SET @\<name\> = \<value\>
- SELECT @\<name\>
- IF (\<expression\>) [BEGIN \<some action\> END] ELSE []
- CREATE TABLE; INSERT; IF (NOT EXISTS(SELECT * FROM abc)) BEGIN THROW 'No
  rows' END 
- DECLARE @i INT = 1; WHILE (...) BEGIN DECLARE @Name = nvarchar(100); SELECT
  @Name from abc where N - @i; PRINT @name; @i += 1; END

# Notes on Lab

## Window functions

- ROW\_NUM: can generate row numbers based on data, its order and partitioning
  based on certain rows of data
- RANK(): it will apply indices based on some value, it numbers stuff with the
  same values the same, but it then skips numbers to catch up on the actual
  numbering
- DENSE\_RANK(): will not skip numbers after having to be the same
  consecutively
- LEAD will output a col from the next row in this one
- LAG will output a col from the previous row in this one
- NTILE(n) will split the output into n parts and number them
- EXISTS checks for any returned rows and returns bool; can be used to replace
  s1 IN(...) AND s2 IN(...) AND s3 IN(...) and so on
- exists can be used in WHERE as well as in SELECT statements, and one might do
  something similar to an INNER JOIN, but without the actual join
