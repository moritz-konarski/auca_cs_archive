# Notes

- programming objects in sql
- why do we use objects in programming?: to make it easier to read, organize
  it, make it reusable, maintenance/testing is easier
- can we avoid syntax errors by using principles of object oriented
  programming?: you can not handle syntax errors in this way, as they appear
  during compilation; runtime errors might be caught this way
- VIEW: a named query that is saved in the database to be used later in other
  qeuries; kind of a permanent CTE or subquery; 
    - CREATE VIEW \<name\> AS \<query\> GO
    - can then be used like any other CTE or subquery
- scalar, table-valued, aggregate functions
    - scalar: maybe parametrized, returns a scalar value:
        - CREATE FUNCTION \<name\> (\<variables names\>) 
            @\<variable\> INT
            RETURNS INT
            AS 
                BEGIN 
                    \<code\>
                RETURN \<variable\>
            END
        - e.g. removing all spaces from a string, getting price of a dish for
          a specific date
        - can be used everywhere where we can use scalar values
    - performance is almost always more important than readability, so it might be
      more desirable to write a fast query vs a nicely readable one
    - table-valued function
        - CREATE FUNCTION \<name\> (\<arguments\>)
            RETURNS table 
            AS 
            BEGIN
                \<code\>
            END
        - this, too, is not the most time efficient way of doing things, but
          it's really useful to make stuff short and readable

__Homework__: learn about multi-statement table functions and stored procedures
