# Lecture Notes

- what type of diagram did we use?
    - model: represents something from the real world, generally in simpler
      terms or a chosen tookit
    - one thing can be modeled in different ways, thus we choose the one that
      fits our purpose the best
- do diagrams fit the modeling of information systems?
    - difference between db and program: db generally does not have a UI,
      access rules, 
    - you have to keep the connection between db and program in mind as you
      might miss something important like access control, security
    - one should use appropriate tools for the modeling step

## ER Modeling

- ER (entity relationship) model, result is an ER diagram
- extract entities and define the connections between them
- entity: reflects to tables in the db; they contain instances of the same 
  type; set of objects of the same type which share certain characteristics
- modeling is the extraction of entities from the subject area
- we need to set up some kind of boundaries of the model, otherwise we will
  never finish
- three types:
    - conceptual model - abstract bubbles
    - logical model - general case of relation dbs
    - physical model - actual implication with specifics

## Game

- extract entities from information system used by librarians for the book
  managing
- books: author, title, ID, year of publication, loaned when to whom
- readers: name, address, books loaned, membership fee
- shelves: which books are there, location in the library
- book categories/genres
- staff
- buildings if there are multiple franchises

## Normalization - for next week

# Lab Notes

- next class we will start from a conceptual model of databases

## Improvement

- should have a separate table for currencies that is connected to the vending
  machines
- country, city, just address is redundant and should be a separate entity
- store GPS as two numbers for north south east west; or use location datatype
  from sql
- add check constraints where they would make sense
- add weight to product type
- allowed types of products per vending machine
- currency should be connected to prices and then to vending machine
- just store final prices without the conversion, in multiple currencies if
  needed
- currency also connected to country; multiple separate prices + currencies
  fields for each product to VendingMachine table
- add a flags table that can hold all the messages the database creates or
  sends
