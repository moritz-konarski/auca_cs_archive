# Midterm Notes

## Labs

- to see the return code: `echo $?`
- for syscall numbers `/usr/include/asm/unistd_64.h`

### `true`

- returns 0 (C false)

### `false`

- returns 1 (C true)

### `yes`

- prints `y` or provided arguments separated by spaces forever
- use print, strlen
```C
    long strlen(const char *s) {                                                    
        long i;                                                                     
        for (i = 0; s[i] != '\0'; i++) ;                                            
        return i;                                                                   
    }
```

### `echo`

- print space-separated arguments, ending in a newline

### `cat`

- `openat` for file
- for each argument:
```C
    ssize_t bytes_read;
    while((bytes_read = read(fd, buff, BUFF_SIZE)) > 0) {
        write(1, buff, bytes_read);
    }
    close(fd);
```

### `pwd`

- `getcwd` syscall

### `touch`

- if file does not exist: create empty file
    - `openat` with arguments -- `O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_NOCTTY|O_NONBLOCK`
- if file exists -- update time stamp
    - `openat` with arguments -- `O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_NOCTTY|O_NONBLOCK`

### `mkdir`

- `mkdir` with `0777` as argument
- user, group, other

### `mv`

- `renameat2(AT_FDCWD, "test/", AT_FDCWD, "test-2/", RENAME_NOREPLACE) = 0`
- this is done for any type
- move all but the last file into the last location

### `rm`

- for `rm -rf`
```C
    unlinkat(AT_FDCWD, "test-2/", AT_REMOVEDIR) = 0
```
- for `rm`
```C
    unlinkat(AT_FDCWD, "touch_2.c", 0) = 0
```

### `cp`

- if `cp -r`
    - check if dir exists with fsstatat
        - if not, `mkdir`
    - for each file in the directory -- open the file, read from it, then write
    to it
    - all with `openat`
- if just `cp`
    - stat both files to check existance
    - read from one file, write to the other one

### `ls`

- `openat(AT_FDCWD, ".", O_RDONLY|O_NONBLOCK|O_CLOEXEC|O_DIRECTORY) = 3`
- then `fstat(3, {st_mode=S_IFDIR|0755, st_size=4096, ...}) = 0`
- `getdents64(3, 0x55dc15be8420 /* 9 entries */, 32768) = 224`
- then simply write the `names[]` to `stdout`

### Introduction

- most fundamental system program is the operating system
- it manages the computer's resources and provides a base for application
development
- Hardware $\rightarrow$ Kernel $\rightarrow$ Applications $\rightarrow$ User
- it does resource management and machine abstraction
- resources:
    - CPU
    - memory
    - disks
    - other devices
- machine abstraction:
    - processes
    - threads
    - files
    - shell
- process, files systems, device abstraction can be modeled as trees
- system calls hide the complexity of the real machine
- single-tasking, multi-tasking, single-user, multi-user are what they sounds
like
- real-time operating system -- should not have a time delay on the input
- distributed -- separate nodes that are networked
- embedded os -- specific tasks for non-pcs
- library os -- single address-space machine that has the bare minimum of stuff
for programs to run and they are then compiled and run directly on hardware
without an os
- microkernel: bare minimum runs in kernel space, the rest in user mode
- hybrid kernel: mix of things -- Windows, OS X
- monolithic kernel: everything but applications run in kernel mode -- Linux

### History

#### 1945 to 1955

- plug boards, punch cards

#### 1955 to 1965

- transistors
- assembly languages
- programming languages
- jobs, job control systems, batch systems (jobs without user input than can be
run as resources permit)

#### 1965 to 1980

- integrated circuits
- major os projects: IBM OS/360, CTSS, MULTICS
- multi threading
- time sharing
- UNIX 1970, Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie
- CTSS -> Multics -> UNIX
- first in asm, then later in C

#### 1980 to 1990

- large scale integration circuits -- CPUs
- microcomputers
- PCs
- DOS (apple, microsoft,...)
- GNU, BSD

#### 1990 to present

- internet
- mobile boom
- iot

### Boot Process

1. power up
2. internal firmware
    - BIOS
    - UEFI
    - custom stuff
3. boot loader
    - multiple stages
    - MBR, GPT
4. kernel
    - CPU and hardware setup
5. initialization service
    - init, upstart, systemd, launchd
6. user space programs
    - login, shell

### Processses

- executable format: structure of an exe
- produced by a linker
- format header, program header, then links to code, global and static data
- common formats: PE, ELF, Mach-O
- each process has: pid, state, priority, cpu state (registers, program
counter, stack pointer), virtual memory (memory map), opened files, code, data,
parent id, working directory, exit status,...
- the kernel maintains a list of all the process descriptors
- process states: running, ready, blocked for scheduling
- context switching to give all exes an equal amount of time
- processes can be created and exit when they are done
- io devices can interrupt, the clock can interrupt

#### Context Switching

1. save current cpu state
2. load a CPU state from next executable
3. run that one

#### Threads

- lightweight process that shares some elements with its parent process
- e.g. memory address space, opened files, global data, ...
- they tend to have a private stack, registers, state
- same data structure for processes and threads

### Scheduling

- either compute-bound or IO-bound processes
- the time-bottleneck is either computation or IO
- compute-bound: long CPU bursts, little IO 
- IO-bound: short CPU bursts, a lot of IO
- a scheduler can start and stop these processes to make a efficient use of the
system resources
- preemptive scheduling -- mostly by priority 
- non-preemptive goes by what processes finish when
- fairness and balance are common goals

#### Batch Scheduler

- maximize throughput
- minimize turnabout
- maximize CPU utilization
- first-come first-served
- shortest job first
- shortest remaining time next

#### Interactive Scheduler

- minimize response time
- round-robin scheduling
- shortest process next
- lottery scheduling
- fair-share scheduling

#### Real-time Scheduler

- meet deadlines
- hard real time vs soft real time: 
    - hard real time have deadlines that must be met
    - soft real time has a certain tolerance but still not desirable
- periodic or non-periodic events
