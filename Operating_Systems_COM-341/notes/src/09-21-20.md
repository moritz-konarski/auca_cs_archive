# Class 21.09.2020

- last class we discussed what an OS is, now we will be moving onto history
- how did we get to OSs?

## History

### 1945 to 1955

- Zuse machines from Germany
- manual programming using binary or even cables
- then came punch cards that made stuff easier -- they were helpers for feeding
information to the system
- they used mechanical relays and later vacuum tubes
- no programming languages, not even assembly languages

### 1955 to 1965

- transistors became a thing and that made them smaller and slightly cheaper
- now programming languages and assembly languages became more popular
- one of the first and still active languages is FORTRAN -- many scientific
computing elements depend on it
- precursors were batch and job control languages -- they controlled submission
and execution of programs on computers

### 1965 to 1980

- integrated circuits -- miniaturization and power efficiency
- cheaper computers, more people using them -- first major operating systems
were created
- IBM OS/360 was the first time a laid-out instruction architecture was
implemented -- they really planned stuff out such that all machines in the
series could run each others programs
- MULTICS was a first timer OS where files were organized in a hierarchical
file system that could have many different levels -- it also allowed for
concurrency and thus multiple users through terminals
- MULTICS treated most things like files -- mounted devices etc are all
writable memory locations
- UNIX features were taken from MULTICS and implemented
- Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie et al. did this -- some of the most
influential people ever
- UNIX was just given out for free, you only had to pay for the tape it came on
- then someone created BSD from UNIX
- CTSS -> MUTLICS -> UNIX
- first PCs -- didn't really have resource sharing anymore
- then came Disk Operating Systems (DOS), from Microsoft, Apple, IBM
- XEROX PARK was one of the most influential research projects
- XEROX Alto etc
- Stalman wrote all the utilities because he wanted to -- Torvalds wrote the
kernel -- so this is what happened
