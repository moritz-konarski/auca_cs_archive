## Introduction and Syllabus

- follow rules: mute yourself, use your proper name
- for today:
    - go through syllabus
    - use first lecture
- we will study the internals about operating systems -- generally some GNU
linux distribution
- know the cost of various things that you use
- how are OS utilities made, how they interact
- different architectures and how they influence or limit what we can do
- generally stuff that is asked in interviews and studied in higher years
- recreation of popular UNIX utilities
- 2 larger labs -- some we will do together, others will be individual
- final project: develop a "toy" file system and tools associated: inspect,
defragment
- we need decent knowledge of C to complete the course
- all the prerequisites are courses I haven't done
- supplemental reading is not necessary, but gives insight into how things are
done in Windows or Mac OS compared to Linux
- grade:
    - 30% practice tasks
    - 30% practice final
    - 30% course project
    - 5% participation
    - done with tasks list and the likes
    - exams done with coding interviews
- for all the rules see the syllabus
- some of the projects will modify a linux kernel
- he has been teaching this course for like 10 years now, it's probably the
course he has invested the most amount of time into

## First Question

### Name OSs

- Windows (family of OSs)
- Mac OS
- GNU/Linux (the kernel, distros are e.g. Ubuntu, Fedora, Arch ...)
    - Linux the just the kernel -- the central part of the OS
    - GNU is an organization that maintains a collection of free open-source
    software
- FreeBSD
- iOS
- Android (also based on Linux -- not GNU)

## Slides

### Purpose of the OS

- to run programs (but not needed), memory management, storage management, 
manage hardware -- __manage hardware and time resources__
- provide abstractions for programmers -- e.g. printing to the screen
- general scheme:
    1. Hardware -- does the actual work
    2. Kernel -- very direct access to hardware
    3. Applications -- access to hardware through kernel abstractions
    4. User
- things to manage
    - CPU
    - Memory
    - Disks
    - Other peripheral devices (GPU, ...)
- manage the ideas of processes and threads, files etc for the devices that
don't actually know what they are -- they only know streams of data
- shell as a pretty direct access to the kernel and utilities -- generally
stands for access and not just cli, e.g. Windows Explorer is a type of shell

## Additional Information

- `symbian` was super popular in Nokia and Sony-Ericsson 
- `FreeDOS` is a OS that basically only allows you to access a disk -- many
notebooks ship with it because it is simpler and cheaper than Windows or most
other OSs
- `ReactOS` is an open source implementation of the Windows kernel that will
then be compatible with all the programs and drivers
- `KolibriOS` is super small -- the idea is that it can fit and start from
a 1.4 MB floppy disk
- `TempleOS` -- a OS developed by 1 person with certain mental problems -- he
thought God was talking to him and telling him to do that
