- continue work on the labs
- syscalls -- what are they, why are they needed, etc
- next week we will get a graded assignment -- specifics will 
- syscalls are a direct way to communicate with the OS
- the kernel acts as a security barrier -- keeps people from doing stuff they

- echo -- just print supplied text
- many simple things that are really good at the one thing they do
- then you can use these to build more complicated programs
- we are now stripping away the stuff from the print action
- down to write, then to syscalls, then to assembly
