- use the repo toksaitov/syscall-project to find all the data
- download the data and use it to install the operating systems
- our standard libraries do very little actually, the kernel of the os does
most of the work when it comes to printing etc
- the scripts are kinda finicky, if you don't follow the instructions they wont
work because they depend on specific directories
- `syscall` is way more expensive than a simple function call -- function
calls are just push return address to stack and then jump to func, a syscall
needs the kernel to do stuff, it then also does 
- write `touch` program
-
