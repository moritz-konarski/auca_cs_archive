## General Terminal Commands

- we will cover an important topic
- and we'll work on our server
- they were working on `true` and `false`
- then move on to `yes` and `echo`
- read the two sets of slides that are on `Practice.md`
- explanations of how `cd`, `mv`, `cp`, `ls`, `rm`, `mkdir`, `pwd`, `cat`,
`touch`, `less`, `nano` work -- super basic stuff
- `touch`ing an existing file will change its modification date -- useful for
make and stuff to force recompilation
- `readline` is a C library for interactive cli input
- read book as outlined in presentations
- `bash` supports scripting, who'd have thought
- in C, `0` is `false`, `1` is `true`
- we can use our own `./true` in bash
- write `yes` -- done
- basic stuff about bools, stdio, argc, argv

## System Calls

- system calls are channels of communication
- memory and resources are divided into kernel space and user space
- different levels of access
    1. kernel
    2. drivers
    3. drivers
    4. applications
- this secures and improves programs
- kernel interface is the bridge between kernel space and user space
- puts (application) $\rightarrow$ write (C library) $\rightarrow$ SYSCALL 
(kernel)
- programs cannot do whatever they want, their environment is limited
- the kernel controls what you can do
- using `gdb` to analyse the syscall `write`
