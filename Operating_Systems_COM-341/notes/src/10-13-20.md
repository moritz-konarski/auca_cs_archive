- don't wait till the last moment to start the project, it might take a while
- don't put unnecessary stuff into our private submission repo, it's only for
the code we are supposed to submit
- he might actually give us the machines we had to create in the first part to
allow us to use them and focus on the second part

## Toy Shell

### Fork Syscall

- it forks the process into either:
    - parent, then wait for child to finish
    - child, execute, exit to parent
- implementation of a simple fork syscall
- on AARCH64 we have to use `clone
- use gdb to figure out what happens
- use `set follow-fork-mode <parent/child>`
- `catch syscall` will catch any system call -- we can then examine it
- `c` to continue program
- `layout asm` to show the assembly -- then look for the syscall and copy the
values
- you don't need to use all registers for clone, just give it zero
- we need to get a thread ID and use the `mrs` call that gives the register
- move `tpidr_el0` to the appropriate register
