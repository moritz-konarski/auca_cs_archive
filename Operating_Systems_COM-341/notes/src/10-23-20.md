## Questions about MIPS64EL

- I cannot clobber `a4` in my fork system call. Why? -- Confusion in gcc about
which registers are available in 32 and 64 bit?
- Do we need to do anything about `a3` being the error indication (if `-1`) 
(number is in `v0`) or can we ignore it? 
- watch the office hours
