# Final Graphics Engine Project

## Plan

- [ ] find differences between lab 08 and project
- [ ] move existing code to project source or to lab 08
- [ ] fix imgui implementation on my end, add it to project
- [ ] find out what the individual labs require -- "07 -- procedural geometry",
    "08 -- texturing and mapping", "09 -- particle systems", "10 -- game
    project"
- [ ] optimize performance with engine features
- [ ] anisotropic filtering
- [ ] add normal mapping or bump mapping to engine
- [ ] code snippets from book, Chapters 10.5 to 10.11
- [ ] use normal map online as a tool
- [ ] see lecture 13.04.2020 for more info
- [ ] material properties test: colors, depth testing, culling, blending,
    multiple textures, etc
- [ ] particle systems: distant fog, depth testing
- [ ] game: use billboards
- smoke and particle effects as planes, see lecture 01.05 end for info
