# Lecture 13.04.2020

- bump mapping or normal mapping was discussed last time
- one of the things we have to do before the final exam: add normal or bump
mapping
- today we'll go through the chapters of the book and find out what we have to
modify in our engine
- __read texture mapping (10.5) and then bump mapping (10.9)__
- real height mapping is really good, but it is super expensive, also called
height mapping -- the vertices themselves are what is moved and our surface
itself gets real details
- normal mapping improves the look less than displacement mapping but is a lot
faster
- there are many programs that will help you create normal maps of certain
things
- `NormalMap-Online` is a nice, free, online tool to create normal maps
- the normals should be encoded in a way that allows the normals to be correct
regardless of what orientation the texture is applied in
- _tangent space_ is used for that: +z points away from the surface (same as
normal), x basis vector: in direction of +u, y basis vector goes into +v
- _tangent space_ will be encoded in a matrix that can then be used for
transposition
- we need to calculate the tangent and binormal vectors on how to do that stuff
- the procedural generation is pretty easy for most objects, and for most other
things this data is pre-generated to save time
- __look at Some HLSL Examples (10.11) for code examples that are pretty much
transferable__
    - instead of HLSL `struct` in input we use `attribute` in GLSL
    - instead of HLSL `struct` in output we use `varying` in GLSL
    - `uniform` are values that are the same for all vertices in the system
- look through the shaders and see what is used for tangent space and transfer
that one
- pixel shader == fragment shader
- implementation
    - put the file into `./include/geometries/`
    - add tangents and determinants into `vertex.hpp`, find the binormal in
    vertex directly
    - use `glm::vec4` for tangent: `x, y, z, det`
    - create `struct` triangle or sample vertices 3 at a time -- find out which
    is more efficient
    - every 3 consecutive elements in `_indices` in `geometry.hpp` make up
    a triangle
    - making a class can allow real-time modification of goemetries
    - we need the function `computeBasisVectors()` in our `geometry.hpp` but
    rename it to `computeTangentVectors()` to make the purpose clearer
    - after finishing the tangent generating function we need to submit the
    data to the GPU
    - for this we need to modify `es2_geometry.hpp` in `gl_buffer_data`, we
    need to add 4 extra elements as tangent and put all the correct values
    there
    - add the texture -- we need a separate type of texture for normal values
    - go to `es2_phong_material.hpp` or also `phong_material.hpp` or
    `texture_1_normals`
    - think about adding normals to texture_2 
    - add the required code to the shader so it knows what the data means
    - modify the phong shaders accordingly to the examples in the book
    - whenever the light vector is used in our shader we use a similar
    transformation to the one we have in the book
    - to quickly check of normal mapping works: convert the normal vector 
    instead of the light vectors
    - `tangent_binormal_normal` put into one matrix and multiplied with
    `view_normal`
