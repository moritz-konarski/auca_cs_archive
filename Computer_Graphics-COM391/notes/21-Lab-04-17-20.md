# Lab 17.04.2020

- new additions to the engine
- normal mapping code is for bump mapping and textured plane test is for pure
textures
- new test as material properties test: colors, depth testing, culling,
blending -- two lights that circulate around viewers head, red sphere,
checkerboard background, sphere also has checkerboard
- __take notes on the things that we talked about__
- play around with the _Imgui_ thing that he provided
- most things are added to the materials class, a bunch of bools and enums that
specify behavior
- stuff is not submitted in `material.hpp`, es2 is made for that 
- one might be able to inherit parts of `es2_phong_material` from
`es2_constant_material` if one wanted to,, but that sounds like a clusterfuck
- in the material all the bools are used for `glEnable(<feature>)` depending on
what is specified
- all of these variables that we specify are generally stored in the GLContext
pointer 
- depth testing is important to figure out if objects are actually in view or
if another thing is in front of it, the color will not be drawn. Sometimes
objects should also be drawn even if they are obscured for some kind of super
vision or something
- depth testing is only used to determine if color is supposed to be shown and
thus for whether or not it is visible
- face culling is removable geometry that is not drawn because it is not
visible 
- this is done through winding order, the direction in which the vertices of
a triangle are numbered in -- clockwise or counterclockwise -- and that differs
between looking at the front or the back of the face. This allows the API to
discard inner faces of shapes and make drawing easier
- if one wants to see inside of objects the culling face can be swapped from
front to back to only render inside faces
- blending = managing the transparency of objects and stuff, especially if they
intersect or are in front of each other
- the blending stuff is also available in our lab
