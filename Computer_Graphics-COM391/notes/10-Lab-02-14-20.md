# Lab 14.02.2020

## Changes made to code

`shaders`

- added emission_color to have standard color
- adder point_size to make the point size modifiable

`aur.hpp`

- AU renderer
- umbrella header contains everything from a particular header
- common approach to make libraries more usable

`material`

- we can now set emission color and size
- now there is information about a dead shader that will the endless error
messages

`objects`

- changes to getters and setters
- model matrix, world matrix: it is simpler to work with an object if it has
its own coordinate space and then just put it together with the other spaces
- world space, object (or model) space, camera space: the common types of
spaces
- looking through different lenses is simplified by having different spaces and
putting camera and stuff into a common space
- any coordinate space can be encoded using a matrix
- we can put one object into a different coordinate space -- useful for
transformations related to other objects
- we can change model spaces and that is what parents are for in `object.hpp`
- the `requires_update` is optimization of matrix multiplications so that they
are only carried out when it is necessary

`object.hpp`

- now is a tree
- root has `null` parent
- can have multiple children, share coordinate spaces
- to get the world matrix we step up the tree until one parent has one
- the tree needs to be traversed, right now the order is not considered or
optimized, in reality we would do that
- now we consider the z-values of objects to figure out if some of them should
be rendered or not

`camera`

- further optimizations

## Testing

- adding rectangle as child of the triangle rotates the rectangle around the
triangle as the whole world space of he world space is rotated

## Exercise

- create a model of the solar system using the different coordinate spaces to
make rotation easier
- circle vertices will be empty
- loop to 100 that adds vertices to circle by using sine and cosine to create
a circle model
- keep the pi constant as float for safety
- `float angle = ...; x = cosf(...); ...; circle.push_back(Vertex{{x, y, 0.0f}}`
- factor out radius and vertex count vars for the circle
- radius of `0.5f` 
- `auto circleGeometry = std::make_shared<ES2Geometry>(circleVertices);`
- `circleGeometry->set_type(GL_TRIANGLE_FAN)`
- `auto material = ::make_shared<const_mat>`
- `mat->set_emission_color(glm::vec4(...))`
- `auto name = ::make_shared<Mesh>(circlegeom, mat, glm:vec3(pos))`
- `name->set_name("name");`
- `name->set_scale(glm::vec3(x,y,z));`
- now we'll just make moon child of earth, earth child of sun
- they should all rotate accordingly now`
- it works and in real life a lot of things move in relation to each other
