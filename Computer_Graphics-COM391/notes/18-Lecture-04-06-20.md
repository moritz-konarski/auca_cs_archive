- more talk about textures
- we have been given sample code to work with
- create a new test that he'll hopefully explain at some point
- test the code that is now lab 7 and then look into the `ImGui` implementation
- _texel_ -- pixel in a texture map
- texture mapping is totally up to the programmer today while earlier there
were only a few specific options
- texels have $(u,v)$ coordinates for each vertex
- in OpenGL $(0,0)$ is in the bottom left by default but we can change that
however we want
- DirectX has $(0,0)$ in the top left corner, so it really depends on the API
and how you code it
- we can now use 2 sets of texture coordinates to use
- Wrap Modes:
    - Repeat: repeats the textures using modulus
    - Clamp to Edge: repeats the last value (1) for all values $\ge 1$
    - Mirrored Repeat: axis is mirrored which gives nice continuity in the
    textures
- Matrix:
    - first row: u max value
    - second row: v max value
    - fourth row: offsetting for x and y
- the matrix may also be used to rotate the textures 
- the texture modes are set in the texture class and then submitted in the GPU
where the actual calculations will be done
- textures can obviously be updated so that you can move it etc
- then the addressing modes are set in `glTexParameteri(...)`
- generally the texture coordinates are called $(u,v)$ but in OpenGL they are
called $(s,t)$
- when we are super close to texels we can see each individual one
- to fix this we may enable a filter that can improve the look by interpolation
- magnification and minification filter or interpolation modes:
    - nearest
    - linear
    - mipmaps
- we also get to choose the coloring mode:
    - addition
    - multiplication
    - mix of two
    - subtraction
    - reverse subtraction
- now textures also work with phong shading so we can update all that stuff now
- multi-texturing: applying more than one texture to a surface at one time
- these textures can then be combined in different ways and enable many
different looks
