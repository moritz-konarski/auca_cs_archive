# Lab 06.03.2020

## Midterm Tests

- target link libraries must be updated

### Window Test

- just a blank window that shows that it works

### Triangle Test

- hello world triangle
- try to animate the triangle, just move it
- and then change the colors of it

### Geometries Test

- generate a bunch of stuff using the geometry generators
- just put them on the screen and animate them
- different color and other parameters
- different mesh types etc -- just all the different options
- 3 planes, 3 circles, 3 spheres

### Scene Graph Test

- just add stuff to parents and make a clock like in lab 5
- test the scene graph and modify it as you need to
- update the clock program for lab 6 because it breaks stuff

### Lighting test

- have three spheres
- two of them are small and rotate around the other big one
- there might be a plane underneath the spheres that the light hits
- try to add as many lights as you can 
- make the lights have different colors
- if it's a really cool scene we could get some extra points
