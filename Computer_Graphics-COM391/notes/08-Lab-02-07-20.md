# Lab 07.02.2020

- today we will work on lab_03
- find the bug and fix it: there should be two triangles on the screen, but
there is only one
- we do we have so many windows and classes? it's inheritance
- bugs:
    - first bug in `es2_constant_material.hpp` -- shader paths were incorrect
    - `glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT);` inside the loop is incorrect, calling it
    before the loop in `es2_renderer.hpp` draws both triangles __this was the
    problem__
