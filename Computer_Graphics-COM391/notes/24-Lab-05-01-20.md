- notes on shot tracing and collision detection
- generate ray from screen through frame
- iterate through all elements and see which one is hit
- optimize checking by like naming object specifically and then deciding
what should happen
- a ray class will be added that goes from some origin into a particular
direction
- ray: line with origin point; could give it certain length and use it for
projectile movement
- encode the direction in unit vector and then get a function that returns
a point at a certain distance
- see how to at `18:00`
- collision algorithms that check all kinds of geometry are cool but
expensive -- won't use them
- we check with simplified geometric objects
- you encode an object by a sphere for example -- algorithms are well know
- axis-aligned bounding boxes are one step up and algorithms are well known
too
- good example for sphere intersection is `viclw.github.io`
- intersection test in ray -- gives intersection and distance
- helper method in camera class that creates our ray
- write nice optimized code that makes sense and create helpers to create all
these elements
- check whole video for examples of how this works
- at `1:05:00` we get a good view of a lot of working code
