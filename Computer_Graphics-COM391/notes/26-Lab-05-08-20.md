- now shooting works and sprites are animated
- sprite sheets are used for optimizations
- we zoom and transform the texture using the transformation matrix 
- this is used to put the right texture in the right spot
- text is difficult, generally libraries are used for that
- find some ways to display text
- use the enemy class
- texture frames are submitted to the enemy class
- how can one use sounds in our engine?
- shooting works through mouse down, unsurprising
- where can we get sprites from?
- use tons of nice textures and maybe write a struct that contains info for the
sprite sheets
- minimize all the GL calls
- implement some kind of fps counter
- merge geometries together to improve performance
- look into instancing of common objects
- avoid if-statements as much as possible
