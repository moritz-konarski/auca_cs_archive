# Lab 10.04.2020

- new test that will be on final exam
- we will have to modify the engine ourselves this time
- we can open pictures in CLion to look at them
- we want to minimize the amount of data that needs to be streamed from GPU
memory to GPU processor because textures tend to be pretty large -- some
methods are:
    1. keep the texture compressed -- generally hard to sample without
       decompressing so not used
    2. use a special format for the texture that allows sampling while the
       texture is still compressed, these are called block compression -- uses 
       all kinds of tricks and is generally not as good as JPG or other 
       dedicated formats
    3. use mipmaps that are basically textures of smaller resolutions that are
       created on the GPU -- sampling a smaller mipmap is more efficient and
       that is generally used for objects that are further away, based on
       distance from the camera -- we can easily ask OpenGL to do this for us,
       mipmaps can also be loaded from disk
    4. another optimization is _anisotropic filtering_ -- if you scale the
       botton checkerboard you can see the bad edges. If you enable some
       filters it looks better but it's still not great. Anisotropic filtering
       takes into account the angle that the texture and camera have to each
       other to fix some of the artifacts
- anisotropic filtering: just one extra GL parameter that we have to supply
- textures are just 2D arrays that shaders have access to and then do with
whatever they want
- normals are used for light reflections off of surfaces -- in between vertices
the values are interpolated to make up the data so that every pixel (texel)
gets a normal
- if we just repeat the normals as a simple form of interpolation, we don't get
a 3D textured look
- if the normals change to reflect the 3D texture of the object, we get
tesselation or Bump Mapping
- modified lab where we have a point light circling above a plane
- now the normals are properly interpolated leading to Bump Mapping
- if we enable bumps we suddenly get a nice 3D looking brick surface that tanks
performance but looks really cool
- even though we only have 4 actual vertices, it looks like we have thousands
- task: __add normal mapping and bump mapping to the engine for the final
exam__
    - the book contains code snippets that we need to adapt
    - normal map texture generators are available online
    - there are also procedural texture generators that make it simple to get
    textures
- low poly objects together with good normal mapping can make stuff look almost
like high poly objects
