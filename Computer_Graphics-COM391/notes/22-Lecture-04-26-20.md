- fog that gradually hides stuff in the distance 
- global property of the scene generally, but we go with granular approach
- is now property of the material and then can be enables etc
- we have exponential, exponential squared, and linear fog
- linear fog is pretty simple, just linear increase in fog from distance x to
distance y
- lamps currently don't have any fog acting on them
- nice an accurate control and cheap but not super realstic
- exponential is exponential, while the squared exponential is more like
a linear curve with a bit of curvature at both ends
- there are some different ways to measure distance from the camera that are
then fed into the fog details
- flat depth is not the most accurate thing because it does not take the
precise distance from the camera but the distance to a z-plane
- radial depth calculation is better fitted but it is more expensive to
calculate
- just play around and figure out what the things do
- another approach is to not apply fog to every pixel but to apply it to every
vertex to speed up the calculations
- the last part will be optimizations
- modern engines attempt to simulate atmospheric scattering too but that is
super complicated
- precomputed atmospheric scattering is also a thing that some people are doing
- we won't be asked to do anything with the fog
- __project:__
    - next week he will tell us exactly what we are going to be required to do
    - collision detection, rays, stuff
- the kind of games we will try to emulate is the original doom _The Ultimate
Doom_ -- one room with walls around, add textures, some enemies, weapons, that
kind of thing -- maybe just a shooting gallery of monsters that go towards to
player -- we can do whatever we want, this gives a lot of extra points
- we will use doom because the geometry of it is very simple and that lends
itself to our imitation -- everything is done in 2D sprites
- enemies in doom always turn towards the player and look at them -- we need to
rotate the enemies accordingly
