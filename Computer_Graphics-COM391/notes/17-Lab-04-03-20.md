## Zoom testing

- we are trying to shared screens over Zoom
- sharing the screen worked decently well -- sharing full screen on windows
does not seem to work well
- just sharing a specific window is not super effective because when we launch
an application window it is not in focus and then won't be streamed
- Windows might not be giving access to the full frame buffer and stuff for
Zoom because it wants best performance -- so this might not be a bad thing,
just a little bit annoying

## New Additions to the code

- _we now have a UI subsystem that can help us debug stuff and change
parameters while the program is running_
- he is using _ImGui_ library to provide this UI subsystem
- `immediate mode graphical user interface = imgui`
- GUI popularized OOP to some degree, but this one is not, it is procedural
- surprisingly easy to use
- uses _immediate mode_: you give instructions and it works immediately -- say
you want a button and you get a button
- styling is obviously limited because that is not the point
- tons of input controls for colors and all that stuff
- library renders itself to a 2D texture that you can then put where ever you
want -- just put it onto a plane -- thus it's simple to implement into our
current graphics engine
- all user input is redirected to the library to enable input to the library
- very procedural in nature -- see the [github
page](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui)
- simple but immensely useful library
- installing it is generally super simple because the library is so popular
- integration can be simple because there are pre-made versions for most
combinations of OS and API
- we use OpenGL3.cpp and the SDL2\_file: `example_sdl_opengl3` and then
integrate them according to the instructions -- maybe just wait for his code
- we render the library on a plane that covers our whole screen, all the input
will also be rerouted through `imgui` because we need to control stuff through
that
- inside of our infinite loop we put the code that creates the `imgui`
- the integration code will be given to us but the creation of the actual ui
will be our task
