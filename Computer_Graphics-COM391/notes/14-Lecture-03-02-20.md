- we talked about the midterms, for that see notes in Google Keep
- now we are talking about shading in a graphics engine
- we're talking about light and lighting sources
- now we have a new directory called lights that contains different light
sources that we can use
- for directional light we only care about the angle of the light and not
actually about the position of the light source because we are simulating the
sun
- next is the point light which has some point of position
- explore this stuff and prepare for the midterm
