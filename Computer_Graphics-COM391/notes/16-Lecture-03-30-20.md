# Lecture 30.03.2020

## Organization

- log in to Zoom was successful - I joined the meeting
- remote classes will most likely last until the end of the semester
- _we will not be able to conduct the theoretical midterm because we do not
have the appropriate proctoring technology_
- __this will mean we will cancel the theoretical midterm and final -- they 
will be replaced by practical coding tasks__
- no theoretical exams -- just practical exams
- there will still be YouTube recordings uploaded
- Friday labs will be a lab at 10:50 because now there are no seat number 
limitations
- there will be no attendance checks though, so we can just re-watch the
session

## Lab 07

- no significant changes except for code cleanup
- code moved to C++ 17 because there are some nice features in there
- new directory called images: one checkerboard pattern, one just a photo (both
creative commons)
- in lab07 we will add support for textures (images that shall be wrapped 
around our 3D objects
- other changes are minor cleanups
- __we added sdl2\_image to the program__ -- maybe it's required to download
that for me + add it to the cmake file
- we're now writing a texture\_test program
- properly setting up working directories is important because we are now using
shaders and images that we need to load

### Setup Steps

1. create a plane to see that it is working
2. now we can write `auto[plane_indices, plane_vertices] = geometry_generators` 
to make is shorter $\rightarrow$ __update the helper functions__
3. create the plane using the aforementioned data
4. use ES2ConstantMaterial -- we don't care about lighting
5. set camera position to fitting coordinates
6. run the program to see if it works
7. add a helper function to file\_utilities that can read the pixel data of 
this image
8. create a `typedef` tuple of a vector of `uint_8` of width, height, number of
channels; called `image_data_type`
9. create `imgage_data_type read_imgage_file(const string &path)`
    - check the documentation, `SDL_Surface *image`
    ```
    image = IMG_Load(path.c_str());
        #include SDL_image
        exit(-1); //plus error message if there is no such path
    ```
    - include the path in the message `auto bytes_per_pixel = surface->format->
    BytesPerPixel` if bytes count is not 3 or 4 complain and
    exit
    - now we return the data by first converting the data into a vector
    ```
    uint8_t *data = static_cast<uint8_t *>(surface->pixels); 
        vector<uint_8> image_data(data, data + surface->h * surface->pitch); 
        SDL_FreeSurface(image); 
        return std::make_tuple(image_data, widht, height, bytes_per_pixel);
    ```
    - previously define `unsigned int width = surface->w, height = surface->h`
10. now we can create a texture 
```
auto[image_data, image_width, image_height, image_channels] = 
    file_utilities::read(path); 
auto photo_texture = std::make_shared<ES2Texture>(image_data, image_width, 
    image_height, imgage_channels); 
material->set_texture(photo_texture);
```
11. run the program and encounter an error -- fix it by checking the fragment
    shader where the color from the texture will just be added to the color of
    the background -- replace the addition by multiplication
12. now it works but the image is flipped because the picture has its own
    coordinate space too -- botton left $\{u:0, v:0\}$, top left $\{u:0, v:1\}$,
    top right $\{u:1, v:1\}$, bottom right $\{u:1, v:0\}$
13. to fix the flipped picture -- we could just flip it when reading it in
    (back to front) or one can change the way the coordinates are interpreted
    by OpenGL which would be the more appropriate way to do it; This can be
    specified in the plane generation where the texture coordinates get added
    to the vector and flip `u` and `v` there -- __we can do it in both ways and
    there is no good or bad way to do it__

## Homework

- can he control our computers and other forms of interactivity
- flip the image around so that it is displayed correctly in the program
- everyone that is able to do it will get +0.5 points -- so do it and send him
an email because I will not be able to join the session (probably)
