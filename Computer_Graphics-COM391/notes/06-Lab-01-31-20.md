- matrices: n rows by m columns $n \times m$ matrix
- vectors: bold lower case __b__ or $\vec b$ 
- matrices: bold upper case __M__
- matrix elements: matrix name lower case with subscripts $m_{11}$ for matrix
__M__, in programming we generally use 0, so it's $m_{ij}$ with $i,j=0$
- whether or not indices start from 0 or from 1 depends on the programming
language or even between libraries
- identity matrices __I__ are kinda like 1 in the scalar world, __I__
multiplied by any matrix __M__ yields __M__
- a vector is basically a row or column of a matrix
- row vector = $1 \times n$ matrix, column vector = $n \times 1$ matrix
- transposing a matrix = rows become columns -- $m^T_{ij} \rightarrow m_{ji}$
- scalar multiplication: all components of the matrix multiplied by scalar
- matrix multiplication: $M \times N$ for `ncols(M) == nrows(N)`, resulting
matrix will have `nrows(M)` and `ncols(N)`
- matrix multiplications are mostly used for transformations: translation,
rotation, magnification
- matrix multiplication is not commutative, except for multiplications with
identity matrices
- $\vec a \times B$ must conform to the same rules as $A \times B$
- matrices are very useful and generally pretty compact
- we can use $\vec i, \vec j, \vec k$ to get specific columns of a matrix,
basically getting all $x,y,z$ values, the generally have length 1 -- __basis
vectors__
- by modifying $\vec i, \vec j, \vec k$ we technically modify the whole
coordinate system
- the rows of the matrix that contains the basis vectors are the basis vectors
- this can be use to scale and rotate objects -- __transformations__
- we use Euler angles to specify angles -- what are they?
