# Lab 17.01.2020

- stuff that we need: python, cmake, conan
- some libraries:
    - SDL2 -- we will use this one
    - GLFW
    - SFML
    - Allegro
- SDL2 is not natively supported in Windows and MacOS
- we need to find out what we can do with our drivers
- for this we will use GLEW or GLAD
- we will be allowed to copy and paste a lot of the boiler plate code in the
exams
- go to the conan docs to find out what we need to do
- go to the SDL documentation for info on how stuff works
- __look up what conan needs for windows compilation__
- __set up all this stuff in CLion__
- __setup the whole path and compiler shit__
