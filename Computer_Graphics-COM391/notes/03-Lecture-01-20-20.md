## History of Computer Graphics

- tech was first used for military purposes _obviously_
- one of the first games was run on radar equipment to play tennis on a CRT
screen
- Vannevar Bush (scientist at Los Alamos) postulated a system similar to our
modern internet and inspired many other systems we use today
- _1963:_ a scientist that was inspired by Bush was Ivan Sutherland who created
a pen used for inputting stuff to a computer ("Light Pen" on "Computer
Sketchpad") -- first CAD program
- _1968:_ "The Mother of All Demos" called this because it showed windows,
hypertext, computer graphics, GUI, video conferencing, computer mouse,
word processing, collaboration in real time
- _1975:_ "The Utah teapot" was the first 3D reference model used in computer
graphics
- people got to thinking on how to simulate the real world, lighting, etc.
- _1973:_ Phong shading algorithm was one of the first ones that kinda worked
- `Smalltalk` was designed at _Xerox Parc (Palo Alto Research Center)_ to make developing GUIs easier and it was the first object oriented programming language
- _1984:_ Mac enters the scene and has a lasting influence on computer graphics
- _1984:_ Tron was the first movie that heavily used CGI
- _1985:_ SGI develops a graphics API that eventually became OpenGL
- _1995:_ Toy Story was one of the first entirely computer generated feature
films, at that time is was still owned by Steve Jobs

## Dedicated graphics chips

- the have a lot more cores
- the cores have less cache or share cache
- the whole architecture is extremely parallel, many pixels can be computed at
the same time
- we have clusters of Streaming Multiprocessors which have clusters of cores
with their own cache
- CPU designers: Intel, AMD, ARM, IBM, Qualcomm ...
- most assembly for GPU is secretive because it is unique or might be a great
advantage
- to interact with the card you have to go through a closed driver which does
not reveal any proprietary information
- we have OpenGL, OpenGL ES, Vulkan, DirectX (Direct 3D libraries)
