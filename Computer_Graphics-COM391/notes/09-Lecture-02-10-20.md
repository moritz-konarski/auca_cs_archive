## Bug in new rendering code

- the main problem in the problem was `glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT)` being
called in the loop
- another problem was having incorrect or missing memory management, `goto end`
went to `end: return 0;` which is insufficient and will result in
a segmentation fault

## Memory Management in C++

- we have a stack and heap like in Java
- in c++ we can create objects where ever we want
- if we refer to stack variables outside of scope we will get a segmentation
fault because there is nothing there
- if we put stuff on the heap, like the two triangles in our program, we need
to free it before exiting out
- in Java the garbage collector takes care of unused objects (like triangles) 
and the memory will be de-allocated -- not in c++ though, and gc is slow
- a gc stops the program and scans for stuff to free, but this is slow, in c++
you need to do that yourself
- the `triangles` all point to some of the same data, so removing that
stuff would give an error and break the program
- `pointer` = points to some memory address, also `NULL`
- `reference` = also points to some memory address, but it must always point 
to something, not `NULL`
- `**var` is a pointer, `&var` is a reference
- references have a problem with object oriented inheritance: if we want to use
inheritance in certain instances we cannot use references and must use
pointers -- problems might arise from that
- `c++11` added smart pointers which is a type of reference counting
- we can use `unique_ptr`, `shared_ptr`, `weak_ptr` classes that allow wrapping
pointers and make them safer
- in the code `geometry` and `material` are raw pointers, when passed to `Mesh`
we wrap them in `shared_ptr` in that constructor
- there we create two shared pointers for the triangles twice because of
a coding error, when the pointer was removed for the first time all was well,
but then the second copy of `shared_ptr` is decremented to 0 and the 
destructor tries to remove the stuff, and it crashes
- __see the recording or uploaded code for the new implementation of the shared
pointers__
- on Friday we will talk about coordinate spaces -- this will mean that we will
need to restructure our code into an object tree that will help us use the
program more efficiently -- this will create pointers from parents to children
and from children to parents
