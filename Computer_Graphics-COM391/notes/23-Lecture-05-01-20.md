# Lecture 01.05.2020

- just use some version of the engine to get bump mapping working
- there are sources in lab 08 that we can play around with
- move everything to lab 08 code level and build:
- bump mapping
- doom clone:
    - sprites are just 2D, there is not a lot of 3D going on
    - the planes always point towards the camera
    - _billboards_ are planes that always rotate towards the camera
    - smoke and particle effects are generally planes
    - mouse control of camera is to be implemented -- in `sdl_window`
    - of `mouse button event` and `mouse move event` -- we get absolute $x,y$` 
    and relative $x,y$ from last frame -- nice for moving screen
    - set mouse mode and capture mouse to `true` -- `SDL_CaptureMouse` and
    `SDL_SetRelativeMouseMode` at `15:00 min`
    - 
  
- Tests:
    - [ ] general usage test
        - [ ] use lights as slower moving bullets
        - [ ] ground plane with lamps and textures to set the athmosphere
        - [ ] copy camera move code from Lecture 10 `20:00 min`
            - move in the direction that the camera point in
        - [ ] window set_on_mouse_move for camera rotation at `22:00` 
            - add sensitivity setting in globals
        - [ ] add billboards that move towards the player
            - look_at_matrix is a function `28:30` code added to es_2_material
            - need to disable linear filtering -- otherwise is looks like mush
        - [ ] set movement to be on the plane always
        - [ ] make random spawn for monsters 
        - [ ] simulate steps using `sin` and `cos`
        - [ ] create a full billboard like at `37:00`
        - [ ] figure out line-of-sight tracing
        - [ ] figure out collision tracing for shooting
    - [ ] lighting test
    - [ ] material properties
    - [ ] normal mapping test
    - [ ] other geometries test
    - [ ] scene graph test
    - [ ] textured plane test
    - [ ] triangle test
    - [ ] window test
